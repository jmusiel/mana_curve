# auto_goldfish

A factored Monte Carlo optimizer with CRN-paired marginal analysis for goldfishing commander decks.

Runs "goldfishing" simulations (playing games without an opponent) to evaluate deck performance, mana curves, and consistency metrics across thousands of games.

## Features

- **Goldfishing engine** -- simulates drawing, mulligans, land drops, and spell casting over N turns
- **Parallel simulation** -- uses multiple CPU cores via `ProcessPoolExecutor` for fast results (configurable `workers` parameter, defaults to all CPUs)
- **Data-driven card effects** -- ~4,750 cards with special abilities (ramp, draw, cost reduction) defined as composable effects in `card_effects.json`. 109 hand-curated + ~4,640 auto-labeled via LLM (Gemini/Ollama/Claude)
- **Archidekt + Moxfield integration** -- pull decklists directly from Archidekt or Moxfield URLs via their public APIs (Moxfield uses an `auto-goldfish/<version> (+repo URL)` User-Agent by default; set `MOXFIELD_USER_AGENT` to override with a partner credential)
- **Draw/ramp optimization** -- three algorithms for finding optimal deck configurations (land count, draw, ramp cards): Hyperband successive halving, CRN-paired racing, and factored evaluation with adaptive sampling. Set max draw/ramp additions to 0 for a simple land-only sweep
- **Hypergeometric mana model** -- instant land count recommendations in microseconds without simulation. Turn-by-turn expected mana tables, on-curve probabilities, and mulligan modeling use hypergeometric distribution math; the headline land-count *recommendation* is a closed-form formula whose coefficients are calibrated to simulator-optimal land counts across ~100 real decks, anchored to a consensus baseline (avg-CMC-3.0 → 37 lands). Recalibrate via `scripts/fit_land_model.py`; see `docs/adr/0003`
- **Card performance analysis** -- identifies which spells drive game quality. Simulator-equivalent cards (same cmc and same registered effects) are pooled into a single entry labelled `{cmc}-mana spell` (e.g. "2-mana spell: Draw 2 cards" pools Night's Whisper + Sign in Blood). Card type (creature vs sorcery vs artifact) is intentionally ignored in the UI since the simulator treats them identically. For pools with multiple copies, the dashboard reports a per-copy effect for each ordinal (1st, 2nd, 3rd, …): how much more (or less) mana the deck spends when you draw that copy vs having one fewer, with a 90% CI. Pills are only emitted for k values where both the "drew k" and "drew k-1" buckets contain at least 30 games — undersampled and physically-rare ordinals are dropped rather than shown as noise. When the 1st or 2nd copy bucket is just below the 30-game floor, the engine runs additional natural goldfishing games (rejection top-up, capped at 2× the user's sim count) and merges their per-pool draw counts back in. The dashboard reports "+N supplemental games" when this kicks in. Pills marked "too noisy" had enough samples but the CI straddles zero (the effect is too small to distinguish from chance). Each pool gets a plain-English Recommendation badge — `↑ Add more`, `≈ Sweet spot: m–n copies` (saturated, with a hypergeometric deck-build range translating "saturates at k in hand" to suggested copy counts in the deck — currently 33% min-draw / 25% max-waste thresholds), `↓ Cut copies`, or `? Need more data`. Saturated badges colour-shift when the current copy count falls outside the suggested range (orange "trim toward N" if too high, blue "could add more, up to about N" if too low). When the deck-size/turns context is missing, the badge falls back to `≈ Enough drawn at k` wording. Directional badges (`↑`/`↓`) require leading evidence: the first emitted marginal must itself be significant. A lone late-k signal isn't enough to recommend acting, because games that drew the kth copy also tend to have drawn more cards overall — so high-k positive marginals are partly inflated by selection on card-flow rather than the kth copy itself. Pools drawn in nearly every game (marked `∑`) score the sum of statistically-significant per-copy effects, since there's no "drew none" comparison group. Pure lands are excluded; MDFCs (cards with a land + spell face) are kept because their spell side affects mana spent
- **Game replay viewer** -- interactive turn-by-turn replay of sample games from top/mid/low quartiles, showing hand state, played cards, board state, and mana production (works in both sequential and parallel modes)
- **Web UI** -- Flask-based dashboard for importing decks, running simulations, and viewing inline results with charts and replay viewer. After import you land on a per-deck **Deck Home** that leads with an instant land-count verdict (closed-form mana model), then funnels into the full simulator where the CASTER score appears in results. Card effects editor lets you override effects before running, with overrides persisted across sessions. Results appear inline below the form for an iterative tweak-and-rerun workflow
- **Client-side simulation** -- simulations run entirely in-browser via Pyodide (CPython compiled to WebAssembly). The Flask server is a thin data layer; all compute happens on the user's hardware with a progress bar and full results rendering
- **Ramp Tradeoff analysis** -- compares generic two-mana Signet-equivalent variants of the simulated deck, showing early-ramp likelihood, expected unspent mana, stuck cards, spend rate, and cautious diagnostic callouts. Tradeoff panels are loaded from saved result data without re-running the simulation
- **Deck scoring** -- D&D-style stat block (the **CASTER** profile: Consistency, Acceleration, Snowball, Tuning, Efficiency, Reach) on a 1-10 scale, derived from simulation metrics and decklist structure, plus a single **overall** headline (the plain mean of the six axes) for at-a-glance comparison. Use `--score` in the CLI or call `compute_deck_score()` programmatically. The 1-10 anchors are calibrated on-the-fly from previously-persisted simulations (Bayesian-shrunk toward defaults so cold-start is sane); set `AUTO_GOLDFISH_CALIBRATE=0` to fall back to defaults
- **Reports** -- generates text reports with per-bucket game stats and mana curve scatter plots (PNG)

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11+. Uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Or install in editable mode:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Run with a saved deck JSON
.venv/bin/python -m auto_goldfish.cli.main --deck_name vren --deck_url https://archidekt.com/decks/19226307/vrens_murine_marauders

# Sweep land counts 36-39, 8 turns, 10k sims
.venv/bin/python -m auto_goldfish.cli.main --deck_name vren --min_lands 36 --max_lands 39 --turns 8 --sims 10000

# See all options
.venv/bin/python -m auto_goldfish.cli.main --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
# Start the Flask development server
.venv/bin/flask --app src.auto_goldfish.web:create_app run --debug
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 to import decks, run simulations, and explore results including the interactive game replay viewer.

Simulations run client-side via Pyodide (WebAssembly) -- the Flask server serves deck data and the UI, but all simulation compute happens in the browser. The first run takes ~10s to load the engine; subsequent runs are fast. Build the wheel first with `uv build --wheel` so the endpoint can serve it.

#### Demo Decks

The dashboard ships with three synthetic mono-black decks designed to exercise the optimizer's adaptive sampling. They appear at the top of the deck list in pedagogical order:

| Deck | Composition | What it demonstrates |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `mana-starved-demo` | 18 lands, 81 spells at CMC 5–7 | Severely under-landed. The optimizer should strongly recommend adding lands; effects are large and detected after the first batch of paired games. |
| `equilibrium-demo` | 37 lands, 62 spells at CMC 2 | Already close to a stable equilibrium. Marginal changes have small effects; adaptive sampling typically classifies them as negligible or runs more games to resolve ambiguity. |
| `overlanded-cantrips-demo` | 45 lands, 54 spells at CMC 1 | Way over-landed. The optimizer should recommend cutting lands; flat curve and excess mana make every change quickly detectable. |

Pick one on the dashboard, run a simulation with the **Factored** algorithm, and observe how the recommendations and per-marginal `n_games` differ across the three decks.

### Deploying to Vercel

The app deploys to Vercel as a serverless Flask function with static assets served from the CDN. Simulations run client-side via Pyodide — Vercel only handles the thin data layer (deck imports, DB persistence, template rendering).

1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) or connect your GitHub repo in the Vercel dashboard
2. Set environment variables in Vercel project settings:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (optional) — Neon Postgres connection string
   - `SECRET_KEY` — Flask secret key for sessions
   - `AUTO_GOLDFISH_CALIBRATE` (optional, defaults to enabled) — set to `0` to disable on-the-fly scoring anchor calibration and use built-in defaults instead
   - `AUTO_GOLDFISH_SKIP_MIGRATE` (recommended for production) — set to `1` so each cold-start worker skips schema migrations; `scripts/vercel_build.sh` runs `python scripts/migrate.py` once at deploy time instead
3. Deploy:

```bash
vercel
```

The build script (`scripts/vercel_build.sh`, wired up via `vercel.json`'s `buildCommand`) builds the Pyodide wheel, copies static assets to `public/` for CDN serving, then runs `scripts/migrate.py` to apply schema changes once per deploy. The `vercel.json` config routes static files directly and everything else to the Flask serverless function.

### Database Persistence (optional)

Simulation results and deck card labels can be persisted to a Neon Postgres database. Install the `db` extra and set `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
uv sync --extra db
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname" .venv/bin/flask --app src.auto_goldfish.web:create_app run
```

Tables are created automatically on first startup. If `DATABASE_URL` is not set, the app works without a database (all data in-memory/disk as before).

### As a library

```python
from auto_goldfish.decklist.loader import load_decklist
from auto_goldfish.engine.goldfisher import Goldfisher

deck = load_decklist("vren")
gf = Goldfisher(deck, turns=8, sims=1000)
result = gf.simulate()

print(f"Mean mana spent: {result.mean_mana:.1f}")
print(f"Consistency: {result.consistency:.3f}")
print(f"Bad turns: {result.mean_bad_turns:.2f}")

# D&D-style deck scoring
from auto_goldfish.metrics.deck_score import compute_deck_score
score = compute_deck_score(result, turns=10)
print(score.format_block())
```

### Adding a new card

All card effects live in `src/auto_goldfish/effects/card_database.py`. No subclasses needed:

```python
# Single mana producer
reg.register("My New Rock", CardEffects(on_play=[ProduceMana(1)], ramp=True))

# Multi-effect card (draws on creature cast + produces mana)
reg.register("My Engine", CardEffects(
    cast_trigger=[PerCastDraw(creature=1)],
    on_play=[ProduceMana(2)],
    priority=1,
))
```
