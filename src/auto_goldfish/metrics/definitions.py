def consistency(records: List[GameRecord], threshold: float = 0.25) -> float:
    """Left-tail ratio consistency metric.

    Computes the ratio of the mean mana spent in the worst-performing
    fraction of games (defined by *threshold*) to the overall mean.
    Higher values (closer to 1.0) indicate that bad games are not
    significantly worse than the average game.

    Parameters
    ----------
    records : list[GameRecord]
        Per-game simulation records.
    threshold : float
        Fraction of games (sorted ascending) to treat as the "bad tail".
        Default 0.25 (bottom quartile).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        ``mean(bottom threshold games) / mean(all games)``.
        Range is 0.0 – 1.0 where 1.0 means perfect consistency.
