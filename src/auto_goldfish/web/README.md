## How Simulation Works

All simulation runs client-side via Pyodide (CPython in WebAssembly):

1. Page loads `simulate.html`, which initializes a Web Worker (`pyodide_worker.js`)
2. Worker downloads the `auto_goldfish` wheel from `/sim/api/wheel/<filename>` and installs it into Pyodide
3. On form submit, the main thread fetches deck data (`/sim/api/<deck>/deck`) and effects (`/sim/api/<deck>/effects`), then posts to the worker
4. Worker runs `pyodide_runner.run_simulation()`, sends progress updates back
5. On completion, `client_results.js` renders results inline and POSTs to `/sim/api/<deck>/results`. The endpoint returns 200 with `persisted: false` when no `DATABASE_URL` is configured, 200 with `persisted: true` on a successful write, and 500 with an `error` field when persistence is configured but the write fails — so client-side code can distinguish "no DB" from a real outage.

The Curve Value Analysis panel includes a Turn Spend Timeline. It renders the
serialized `curve_value.turn_structure` payload in `static/js/client_results.js`,
the sole results renderer for Pyodide/client-rendered results. The timeline's
spendable spell bars include non-ramp main-deck spells plus commanders; ramp
setup is tracked as its own series.

Ramp Tradeoff panels are computed eagerly only for the land count shown by
default. Each result still carries the saved Ramp Tradeoff input and measured
draw signature, so `client_results.js` can ask the worker to compute other
land-count panels lazily via `pyodide_runner.compute_ramp_tradeoff_json()`
without re-running the simulation.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/sim/<deck>` | Config page with effect editor |
| POST | `/sim/<deck>/overrides` | Save card effect overrides |
| POST | `/sim/<deck>/annotate` | Save card annotation (fire-and-forget, DB optional) |
| GET | `/sim/api/<deck>/deck` | Deck card list (JSON) |
| GET | `/sim/api/<deck>/effects` | Merged effect overrides + registry (JSON) |
| POST | `/sim/api/<deck>/results` | Persist client-side simulation results |
| GET | `/sim/api/wheel` | Latest wheel filename + mtime (for cache-busting) |
| GET | `/sim/api/wheel/<filename>` | Serve wheel file |
| GET | `/runs/` | Renders the 20 most recent simulation runs |
| GET | `/runs/api/data?view=recent\|top\|bottom&stat=<caster>` | Returns up to 20 runs as JSON. `top`/`bottom` rank by the run's optimal-land-count `score_<stat>` and require a stat from the CASTER set; invalid combinations fall back to `recent`. Each run carries a `deck_breakdown` reconstructed from the DB (`CardRow.types_json/cmc` + `DeckCardRow.quantity/is_commander`) -- commanders, mana curve, land count, ramp counts (total + per-CMC bucket), draw counts (cantrip / instant / repeatable). Legacy runs whose deck has no persisted card metadata return `deck_breakdown: null`; the row's "Show" panel exposes an "Open in config" link that re-saves the deck (POST from localStorage or GET from disk) to backfill the metadata. |

## Asset pipeline + static caching

The Pyodide wheel and the static JS/CSS files are all cache-busted via mtime
query strings so editing source on disk is immediately visible in the browser
without a hard refresh:

- **Pyodide wheel** -- `/sim/api/wheel` returns `{filename, mtime}`. The simulate page builds the download URL as `<filename>?v=<mtime>`. `pyodide_worker.js` strips the `?v=...` query string before writing the file to its in-memory FS so micropip still sees a clean `.whl`. Each `uv build --wheel` rebuild bumps the mtime, so the browser refetches.
- **Static JS / CSS** -- `web/__init__.py` registers a `static_url(filename)` Jinja helper that wraps `url_for('static', ...)` and appends `?v=<mtime>`. **Use `static_url` everywhere instead of `url_for('static', ...)`** -- otherwise edits to JS/CSS won't reach the browser without manually clearing cache.

`scripts/start_flask.sh` runs `uv build --wheel --quiet` on every start, so the wheel is always fresh after a server restart. **Editing Python source while the server is running** is auto-reloaded by Flask `--debug`, but the *Pyodide wheel* is only rebuilt on the next `start_flask.sh` invocation. Restart the script to push Python changes into the in-browser runtime.

## Adding a new top-level JS module

Both `simulate.html` (via inline `<script>`) and `deck_store.js` (via
`navigateToSim` / `navigateToManaModel`) load pages by calling
`document.write(html)`. The new HTML re-runs every `<script src=...>` tag in
`base.html`, so any global declarations in those scripts execute **twice** in
the same JS context.

`const Foo = ...` will throw `Identifier 'Foo' has already been declared` on
the second run, aborting the rest of `document.write` processing and leaving
the page non-functional. The canonical pattern is the idempotent guard used in
`client_results.js`:

```js
var Foo = window.Foo || (function() {
    'use strict';
    // ... module body ...
    return {publicMethod1, publicMethod2};
})();
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { window.Foo = Foo; }
```

This makes the second execution a no-op rather than a fatal redeclaration.

## Configuration

- `SECRET_KEY` env var (defaults to `"dev"`)
- `DATABASE_URL` env var -- if set, enables Postgres persistence via `db/` module
- `AUTO_GOLDFISH_CALIBRATE` env var -- defaults to enabled. When the DB is reachable and contains persisted raw composite stats, the `/runs` page tunes the 1-10 score anchors against the empirical distribution (Bayesian-shrunk toward defaults). Set to `0` to fall back to built-in default anchors. The `/runs` page shows a "Calibrated" or "Default anchors" badge with the active values. The `/sim/<deck>` page injects the active anchors into `window.CASTER_CALIBRATION` so `client_results.js` can render the "What does my CASTER Score mean?" expandable panel against current calibration.
